# Google Kubernetes Engine

This is an example Codecov stack deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine using
terraform.  It consists of:
- A kubernetes cluster
- 3 node groups (web, worker, minio)
- A cloud SQL Postgres instance
- A Redis instance
- A cloud storage bucket for coverage report storage.

This stack will get you started with a fully functional Codecov enterprise
stack, but we suggest you review 
[Best practices for Terraform and Codecov](#best-practices-for-terraform-and-codecov) 
for a fully robust deployment.

## Getting started

This stack requires a Google project and an associated project owner service
account.

- Create a new [Google cloud
  project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
- Create a [service
  account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for your project.
- Save the service account json.
- [Grant the project
  owner](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource) role to your service account. TODO maybe `roles/editor` is all that's necessary?
- Define `GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON=/path/to/service-account.json` to allow the 
  Google cloud terraform provider access to your project.
    ```
    # ~/.bashrc
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON=/path/to/service-account.json
    ```
- You will need a DNS hostname to assign to the load balancer IP address (ex:
  `codecov.yourdomain.com`).

## Codecov configuration

Configuration of Codecov enterprise is handled through a YAML config file.
See [configuring codecov.yml](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/configuration) for 
more info.

The terraform stack is configured using terraform variables which can be
defined in a `terraform.tfvars` file.  More info on
[Terraform input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html).

| name | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gcloud_project` | Google cloud project name | required |
| `region` | Google cloud region | us-east4 |
| `zone` | Default Google cloud zone for zone-specific services | us-east4a |
| `codecov_version` | Version of codecov enterprise to deploy | 4.4.4 |
| `cluster_name` | Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster name | default-codecov-cluster |
| `web_node_pool_count` | Number of nodes to create in the web node pool | 1 |
| `worker_node_pool_count` | Number of nodes to create in the worker node pool | 1 |
| `minio_node_pool_count` | Number of nodes to create in the minio default node pool | 1 |
| `node_pool_machine_type` | Machine type to use for the node pools | n1-standard-1 |
| `web_replicas` | Number of web replicas to execute | 2 |
| `worker_replicas` | Number of worker replicas to execute | 2 |
| `minio_replicas` | Number of minio replicas to execute | 4 |
| `traefik_replicas` | Number of traefik replicas to deploy | 2 |
| `minio_bucket_name` | Name of GCS bucket to create for minio | required |
| `minio_bucket_location` | Name of GCS bucket to create for minio | US |
| `redis_instance_name` | Name used for redis instance | required |
| `postgres_instance_name` | Name used for postgres instance | required |
| `codecov_yml` | Path to your codecov.yml | required |
| `ingress_host` | Hostname used for http(s) ingress. (ex: `codecov.yourdomain.com`) | |
| `enable_https` | Enables https ingress.  Requires TLS cert and key | 0 |
| `tls_key` | Path to private key to use for TLS | required if enable_https=1 |
| `tls_cert` | Path to certificate to use for TLS | required if enable_https=1  |

## Executing terraform

After configuring `codecov.yml` and `terraform.tfvars` you are ready to execute
terraform and create the stack following these steps:

1. Run `terraform init`.  This will download the necessary provider modules and
   prepare your terraform environment for execution.  [Terraform
   init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html)
1. Create a plan: `terraform plan -out=plan.out`.  This checks the current
   state and saves an execution plan to `plan.out`.  [Terraform
   plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)
1. If you're satisfied with the execution plan, apply it.  `terraform apply
   plan.out`.  This will begin creating your stack.  [Terraform
   apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)
1. Wait... this will take a little while.  If everything goes well, you will
   see something like this:
     ```
     [...]
     
     Apply complete! Resources: 36 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
     Outputs:
     
     ingress-ip = xx.xx.xx.xx
     minio-access-key = xxxxxxxxxxx
     minio-secret-key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     ```
1. The ingress IP and minio API keys are output at the end of the run.
   Create a DNS A record for the `ingress_host` above pointing at the
   resulting `ingress-ip`.  If you wish to use a tool to access your 
   reports through minio, you can use the key pair above to access it 
   using an s3-compatible tool like the [minio
   client](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide).

## Destroying

If you want to remove your Codecov enterprise stack, a `destroy.sh` script is
provided.  *This will remove all of your enterprise configuration and uploaded
coverage reports.*  All resources created with terraform will be removed, so
use with caution

## Best practices for Terraform and Codecov

This is intended to be an example terraform stack.  As such, it ignores some
terraform best practices such as remote state storage and locking.  For more
info on running a robust terraform stack see [Terraform Recommended
Practices](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/guides/recommended-practices/index.html).

Please review Codecov [Self-hosted Best
Practices](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/best-practices) as well.
